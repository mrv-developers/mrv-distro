Usage
#####
This document gives an overview of the facilities within the Maya portion of the development framework, which contains modules that require maya to be initialized.

The examples given here can be viewed as one consecutive script which should work of all the code is pasted into a mrv testcase for instance. The latter one can be found in ``mrv.test.maya.nt.test_general`` (test_usage_examples). If you want to be more explorative, adjust the test's code yourself and run it to see the results. For more information on how to run tests, see :ref:`runtestsdoc-label`.

It is advised to start a mrv enabled ipython shell allowing you to try the examples interactively, see :ref:`imrv-label`.

To understand some of the terms used here, its a plus if you are familiar with the MayaAPI. If not, it shouldn't be a problem either as knowledge of the MayaAPI is not strictly required.
