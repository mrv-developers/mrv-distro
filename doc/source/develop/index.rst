MRV is a framework onto which new programs are easily being built, and it provides many tools to facilitate development and to help producing good software quickly.

Setting up your development environment is the first step, which involves cloning the MRV mainline repository, and assuring that some prerequisites are met.

The second part of this guide explains the naming conventions used in MRV and tells you about the development practices employed to produce it.

At the end of this article, there are tips on how to optimize your code for performance, and how to contribute to the MRV project.
