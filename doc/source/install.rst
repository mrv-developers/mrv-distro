Installation

This is a developer preview, and there are no easy_install packages yet. If you would like to get a general idea about the framework, have a look at the :doc:`usage/index` article. 

If you want to get the source code quickly, and you are not interested in trying MRV, it will be enough to download a `source archive which does not contain any dependencies <http://github.com/Byron/mrv/zipball/1.0.0-preview>`_.

As a (future) developer, please have a look at the dedicated development section for detailed information on how to get MRV (Preview) up and running: :ref:`development-label`.
